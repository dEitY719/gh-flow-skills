# gh-flow:issue — Step 2.6: Post AI Metrics to Issue (soft-fail)

Runs only if Step 2.5.1 succeeded. Post a flow-level aggregate metrics
comment on the **linked GitHub Issue**. The PR body already carries the
per-step `<!-- ai-metrics:gh-pr -->` block written by `gh-pr:create`; this step
adds the total across all six sub-skills to the Issue so the Issue thread
is the single place to review full AI effort. (The post-PR quality gate
and deferred pr-reply are folded into Step 2.4 `gh-verify:review-all`, so its
row already covers that effort — there is no separate gate/schedule row.)
This step soft-fails — warn on any error but never block the flow.

a. Compute: `ELAPSED=$(( ($(date +%s) - START_TS) / 60 ))`
   Track per-step timing by recording `STEP_TS=$(date +%s)` at the
   start of each sub-skill and computing its elapsed at the end:
   - `IMPL_MIN` — elapsed for Step 2.1 (gh-issue:implement)
   - `COMMIT_MIN` — elapsed for Step 2.2 (gh-pr:commit)
   - `PR_MIN` — elapsed for Step 2.3 (gh-pr:create)
   - `REVIEW_MIN` — elapsed for Step 2.4 (gh-verify:review-all — the quality
     gate + deferred pr-reply scheduling)
   - `CONFLICT_MIN` — elapsed for Step 2.5 (gh-resolve:conflict)
   - `OUTDATED_MIN` — elapsed for Step 2.5.1 (gh-resolve:outdated)
   Any variable not yet computed defaults to `?` in the template.
b. Issue type: parse the conventional-commit prefix from the issue title
   fetched in Step 2.1 (e.g. `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`).
c. Human time: look up the issue type in `gh-issue:create`'s
   `references/metrics-baseline.md` (in the same skills directory).
   For `feat`, infer size from the implementation scope.
d. Token estimate: character count of (issue body + implementation file
   reads) ÷ 4, rounded to nearest 500. Minimum 1 000.
e. Post the aggregate comment on the linked issue (body template below),
   with `GH_HOST` and the repo slug both explicit — this is the flow's only
   direct `gh` call, and a bare `gh api` would follow gh CLI's own default
   repo instead of the `<remote>` the flow was invoked with (dEitY719/dotfiles#1403).
   Skip the post entirely when `GH_DISABLE_AI_METRICS=1` (issue dEitY719/dotfiles#399);
   the six sub-skills already honour the same env var, so a disabled
   run leaves zero ai-metrics artifacts on the issue or PR.
   **Re-derive `GH_HOST`/`TARGET_REPO` fresh in this same Bash call from the
   literal `<remote>` value** — do not trust that Step 1's export survived
   the five `Skill()` calls in between (dEitY719/dotfiles#1498, PR dEitY719/dotfiles#1539 review: a Bash tool
   call is not guaranteed to inherit an earlier call's exports). Paste
   `references/target-binding.md`'s block again here with `<remote>`
   substituted literally, same as Step 1 did.
f. On failure: print `[WARN] ai-metrics comment failed (<reason>) — continuing.`

```bash
_SC="${DOTFILES_ROOT:-$HOME/dotfiles}/shell-common"
[ -f "$_SC/functions/gh_host.sh" ] || { _SC="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-}/lib/vendor/shell-common"; export SHELL_COMMON="$_SC"; }
. "$_SC/functions/gh_host.sh"
REMOTE_URL=$(git remote get-url "<remote>")
TARGET_REPO=$(_gh_parse_owner_repo_url "$REMOTE_URL")
TARGET_HOST=$(_gh_host_from_url "$REMOTE_URL") || TARGET_HOST=$(_gh_resolve_host)

if [ "${GH_DISABLE_AI_METRICS:-0}" = "1" ]; then
    : # ai-metrics comment skipped via GH_DISABLE_AI_METRICS
else
    GH_HOST="$TARGET_HOST" gh api "repos/$TARGET_REPO/issues/$ISSUE_NUMBER/comments" \
      -X POST \
      -f body="### gh-flow:issue 완료
